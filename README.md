</details>

<details><summary>sd</summary>

- Simpler syntax for replacing all occurrences:
  - sd: `sd before after`
  - sed: `sed s/before/after/g`
- Replace newlines with commas:
  - sd: `sd '\n' ','`
  - sed: `sed ':a;N;$!ba;s/\n/,/g'`
- Extracting stuff out of strings containing slashes:
  - sd: `echo "sample with /path/" | sd '.*(/.*/)' '$1'`
  - sed: use different delimiters every time depending on expression so that the command is not completely unreadable
    - `echo "sample with /path/" | sed -E 's/.*(\\/.*\\/)/\1/g'`
    - `echo "sample with /path/" | sed -E 's|.*(/.*/)|\1|g'`
- In place modification of files:
  - sd: `sd before after file.txt`
  - sd:: you need to remember to use `-e` or else some platforms will consider the next argument to be a backup suffix
    - `sed -i -e 's/before/after/g' file.txt`
